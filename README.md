# Knowledge Graph Completion with Relation-Aware Anchor Enhancement

Official code repository for AAAI-25 paper "Knowledge Graph Completion with Relation-Aware Anchor Enhancement"

## How to Run

For WN18RR and FB15k237 datasets, we use files from [SimKGC](https://github.com/intfloat/SimKGC "GitHub - SimKGC").

For Wikidata5M transductive dataset, we provide a script to download the Wikidata5M dataset from its official website. This will download data for both transductive and inductive settings. The dataset can be found at [Wikidata5M](https://deepgraphlearning.github.io/project/wikidata5m "Wikidata5M Project").

The model we are using is bert-base-uncased.
